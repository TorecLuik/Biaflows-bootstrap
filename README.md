# Cytomine Bootstrap

> Cytomine bootstrap is the installer for Cytomine. The application can run on a server to allow remote users to access the web platform or locally on your own machine.

## Overview

[Cytomine](http://cytomine.org) is, to the best of our knowledge, the first open-source rich internet application to enable highly collaborative and multidisciplinary analysis of multi-gigapixel imaging data.

This bootstrap procedure allows you to configure your installation and generate an installer script based on this configuration. 
All Cytomine components run in Docker containers so that the only requirement is Docker.
But now we run through Podman, which can use Docker containers. However, you need to have Podman installed.

## Podman

This repo has been adjusted to use Podman instead of Docker. Note that "--link" is not implemented in Podman (and deprecated in Docker) and was replaced in this setup with a _network_ and _aliases_. 
However to make _aliases_ work, you need to install an extra podman plugin first, 'dnsname':
> git clone https://github.com/containers/dnsname.git

> cd dnsname

> sudo dnf install go

> make binaries

> make install PREFIX=/usr

Now when you create a network, it will have _"dns_enabled: true"_ and allow aliases to communicate to other containers
> podman network inspect \<name>



## Install

**To install *official* release of Cytomine, see @cytomine. Follow this guide to install forked version by ULiege.** 

Follow the detailed guide to install Cytomine:
* [Install Cytomine on Linux](https://doc.cytomine.be/display/PubOp/Install+Cytomine+on+Linux)
* [Install Cytomine on MacOS](https://doc.cytomine.be/display/PubOp/Install+Cytomine+on+MacOS)

Basically,
1. Fill the `configuration.sh` file
2. Generate your installation script by running `bash init.sh`
3. Run the generated script `bash start.sh`

To restart the server, run `bash restart.sh`.
